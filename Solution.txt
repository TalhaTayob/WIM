The problem was solved by two methods. The first solution was done by adding all possible distnaces to list. The distances where then normalized to value between 0 and 5.
Th list of distances were sorted from smallest to longest and a value was assigned based on the normalised value and the frequency of the other attached node to that specific
distance if it had a frequency. A scoring method was made by modelling the expected results (differences of frequency betweem nodes and their distance). The second solution
was made by generating random frequencies and seeing which combination yielded the best scoring result.
